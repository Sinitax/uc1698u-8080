## General

Backlight functional at 3.3V with 320 Ohm

## UC1698u LCD

Supply voltage (Vdd) : 1.8V ~ 3.3V  (3.3V is fine)
Supply current       : <= 15ma

Connect V_LCD-IN to V_LCD-OUT together for internal voltage converter

C_BX = 2.2uF at 5V
C_S = 150 ~ 220nF at 25V
C_L = 330nF at 25V

BM0 and BM1 set LOW for 8080 8-bit parallel mode

CS0 is low active chip select

CD is A0 and controls wether data is DISPLAY DATA (HIGH) or CONTROL DATA (LOW)

WR1 for read, WR0 for write (both low enable)
